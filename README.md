Deployment link : https://sadnan.shinyapps.io/sadnan_appsilon_/

Working on this project was challenging because of the huge data set size(around 20GB). It took some ideas to develop and make optimize the data set so that it dont take much time to load the visualization. 

I used **"shiny","shinydashboard","ggplot2",""shinyjs","shinyjs","plotly","leaflet","leaflet.extras","leaflet.providers","readxl","dplyr","tidyverse","DT"** packages for this project.

**app.R** file contains **ui.R** and **server.R** and the app is run from **app.R** file. css style sheet and other modules are available in **www** folder.
